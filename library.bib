abstract = {GPS-denied aerial flight is a challenging research problem and requires knowledge of complex elements from several distinct disciplines. Additionally, aerial vehicles can present challenging constraints such as stringent payload limits and fast vehicle dynamics. In this paper we propose a new architecture to simplify some of the challenges that constrain GPS-denied aerial flight. At the core, the approach combines visual graph-SLAM with a multiplicative extended Kalman filter. More importantly, for the front end we depart from the common practice of estimating global states and instead keep the position and yaw states of the MEKF relative to the current node in the map. This relative navigation approach provides simple application of sensor measurement updates, intuitive definition of map edges and covariances, and the flexibility of using a globally consistent map when desired. We verify the approach with hardware flight-test results.},

abstract = {Sensors and systems for a fully autonomous unmanned helicopter have been developed with the aim of completely automating the landing and launch of a small-unmanned helicopter from the deck of a ship. For our scheme, we have combined a laser rangefinder (LRF) system with a visual tracking sensor to construct a low-cost guidance system. Our novel LRF system determines both the distance to and the orientation of the deck in one cycle. We have constructed an optical sensor to complement the laser system, comprising a digital camera interfaced to a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), which enables the entire target tracking computation to be achieved in a very small self-contained form factor. A narrowband light source on the deck is detected by the digital camera and tracked by an algorithm implemented on the FPGA to provide a relative bearing to the deck from the helicopter. By combining the optical sensor bearing with the information from the laser system, an accurate estimate of the helicopter position relative to the deck can be found.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel control structure that can achieve fast, safe and precise landing of a VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) UAV onto a vertically oscillating landing pad. The control structure consists of three modules to achieve these goals: a motion estimation module, a trajectory generation module and a tracking control module. In the tracking control module, an ARC (Adaptive Robust Controller) is designed to robustly adapt the nonlinear ground effect to enable a quadrotor accurately track a given reference trajectory. In the trajectory generation module, a time-optimal reference trajectory for the quadrotor is generated such that it converges from the initial height precisely to the platform height with zero relative velocity (for smooth landing). The landing time duration is as short as possible, and physical safety constraints (position, velocity, acceleration bounds etc.) are satisfied during the entire landing process. The above two modules use the motion information of the quadrotor and the platform in absolute coordinate system (inertial frame). In the motion estimation module, we estimate the UAV and platform positions online from only the measurement of the relative distance between the UAV and the platform, as well as the inertia measurement of the UAV. An UKF (unscented Kalman Filter) is constructed and the estimated parameters are fed to the other two modules in real time. Comparative simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the performances of the proposed control structure.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel and practical procedure for estimating the mean deck height to assist in automatic landing operations of a Rotorcraft Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (RUAV) in harsh sea environments. A modified Prony Analysis (PA) procedure is outlined to deal with real-time observations of deck displacement, which involves developing an appropriate dynamic model to approach real deck motion with parameters identified through implementing the Forgetting Factor Recursive Least Square (FFRLS) method. The model order is specified using a proper order-selection criterion based on minimizing the summation of accumulated estimation errors. In addition, a feasible threshold criterion is proposed to separate the dominant components of deck displacement, which results in an accurate instantaneous estimation of the mean deck position. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed recursive procedure exhibits satisfactory estimation performance when applied to real-time deck displacement measurements, making it well suited for integration into ship-RUAV approach and landing guidance systems.},

The VTOL vehicle is assumed to be equipped with a minimum sensor suite [i.e., a camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU)], manoeuvring over a textured flat target plane. Two different tasks are considered in this paper. The first concerns the stabilization of the vehicle relative to the moving platform that maintains a constant offset from a moving reference. The second concerns regulation of automatic vertical landing onto a moving platform. Rigorous analysis of system stability is provided, and simulations are presented. Experimental results are provided for a quadrotor UAV to demonstrate the performance of the proposed control strategy.},

abstract = {Autonomous flight in unstructured, confined, and unknown GPS-denied environments is a challenging problem. Solutions could be tremendously beneficial for scenarios that require infor- mation about areas that are difficult to access and that present a great amount of risk. The goal of this research is to develop a new framework that enables improved solutions to this problem and to validate the approach with experiments using a hardware prototype. In Chapter 2 we examine the consequences and practical aspects of using an improved dynamic model for multirotor state estimation, using only IMU measurements. The improved model correctly explains the measurements available from the accelerometers on a multirotor. We provide hardware results demonstrating the improved attitude, velocity and even position estimates that can be achieved through the use of this model. We propose a new architecture to simplify some of the challenges that constrain GPS- denied aerial flight in Chapter 3. At the core, the approach combines visual graph-SLAM with a multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF). More importantly, we depart from the common practice of estimating global states and instead keep the position and yaw states of the MEKF relative to the current node in the map. This relative navigation approach provides a tremendous benefit compared to maintaining estimates with respect to a single global coordinate frame. We discuss the architecture of this new system and provide important details for each component. We verify the approach with goal-directed autonomous flight-test results. The MEKF is the basis of the new relative navigation approach and is detailed in Chapter 4. We derive the relative filter and show how the states must be augmented and marginalized each time a new node is declared. The relative estimation approach is verified using hardware flight test results accompanied by comparisons to motion capture truth. Additionally, flight results with estimates in the control loop are provided. We believe that the relative, vision-based framework described in this work is an important step in furthering the capabilities of indoor aerial navigation in confined, unknown environments. Current approaches incur challenging problems by requiring globally referenced states. Utilizing a relative approach allows more flexibility as the critical, real-time processes of localization and control do not depend on computationally-demanding optimization and loop-closure processes.},

Using bearings to features on the ship deck and knowledge of helicopter state provided by the INS/GPS, a state estimator computes estimates of deck state and covariance. This deck state estimate can then be used to compute a safe, feasible trajectory to landing. This paper presents an Unscented Kalman Filter based implementation that uses a generic second order kinematic model driven by zero mean Gaussian noise for the ship deck motion model: while this deck motion model contains significant unmodeled dynamics it is not specific to a particular ship. Results of Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the utility of the proposed approach: good estimation results are obtained for stochastic deck motion (with a Pierson-Moskowitz power spectral density) and a fast ferry ship model.},

abstract = {Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations on ships enhance the mission capabilities for military and civilian users. However, landing operations on a ship requires precise control to avoid collision with the ship superstructures. Current approach involves modelling and prediction of the ship deck motion. However, model mismatch often results in a non-zero bounded error response. The approach in this paper eliminates modelling of the ship deck motion and focuses on an analysis method based on the invariant ellipsoid technique to obtain an optimal gain such that the tracking error is restricted to within an optimal bound. Simulations are performed using a realistic ship deck model with the quadrotor tracking a point at a prescribed height above the ship deck before landing. The performance of the proposed controller on a quadrotor was evaluated and is shown to achieve the control objective.},
